## About the website

**Moda Operandi** is an online luxury fashion retailer known for its innovative **“trunkshow”** model, allowing customers to pre-order directly from designers, immediately after their runway show. Founded in 2010 by Lauren Santo Domingo and Áslaug Magnúsdóttir in New York City, Moda Operandi revolutionized the fashion industry by providing a platform for designers to reach consumers directly, bypassing traditional retail channels. The website showcases more than 1,000 designers and brands, including emerging talents and globally established fashion houses. As a private company, Moda Operandi is not listed on any stock market. Additional information on the brand can be found on their [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moda_Operandi) along with the [Bloomberg profile](https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/0756239D:US) providing financial news and updates related to the company.

Moda Operandi competes with other premium online fashion retailers, such as **Net-a-Porter** and **Farfetch**. Net-a-Porter, [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net-a-Porter), [Bloomberg page](https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/2103Z:LN), is a pioneer of luxury e-commerce, offering a blend of luxury designer fashion, beauty products, and editorial content since 2000. On the other hand, Farfetch, [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farfetch), [Bloomberg page](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/FTCH:US), pursues a marketplace model, connecting consumers with a global network of luxury fashion sellers. Despite different models, all these competitors share a need to continually engage high-end consumers with a curated selection of premium fashion items.

The use of web scraped data can have significant implications for Moda Operandis business model. Data such as prices and discounts found on the **Moda Operandi website** can be used for competitor analysis and price monitoring. Being aware of the price strategy of their competitors, Moda Operandi can make informed decisions about pricing their own collections. On the other hand, data on discounts provides insight into the sale tactics of the retailer, helping to predict future discount periods and adapt purchasing behaviour accordingly. Furthermore, web scraped data from Moda Operandi can also contribute to trend forecasting, particularly in identifying the most popular pieces among the pre-order customer base and anticipating future fashion trends.
